# AI Companion App - Development Task List

## Project Overview
AI Companion mobile app built with React Native, Expo Router, Supabase, and TypeScript.

## Core Architecture Analysis

### üèóÔ∏è App Structure (app/ folder)
- **Router Setup**: Uses Expo Router with Stack navigation
- **Main Screens**:
  - (tabs)/ - Tab navigation with index.tsx and explore.tsx
  - auth/ - Authentication screens (get-started, login, signup)
  - +not-found.tsx - 404 error handling
- **Root Layout**: Configured with AuthProvider, ThemeProvider, and i18n support

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema (database.types.ts)
**Core Tables:**
- `characters` - AI companion definitions with system prompts, voices, tiers
- `conversations` - Chat sessions between users and characters  
- `messages` - Individual messages in conversations (with audio support)
- `profiles` - User profiles with premium status and selected character
- `usage_limits` - Track message/voice usage per user
- `tags` & `character_tags` - Character categorization system
- `message_feedback` - Rating and reporting system

**Key Features:**
- Multi-language support (en, es, ja, tr, de, fr, it, zh, pt)
- Gender/tone customization for characters
- Audio message support
- Usage tracking and limits
- Premium tier system

### ‚ö° Supabase Configuration (supabase/config.toml)
